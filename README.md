# Václav Vančura fonts

A set of fonts I create before I die.

* TatraBitmapStandard
* TatraBitmapHeavy
* XychtScript Light
* XychtScript AtSkul

If you use XychtScript AtSkul, try to combine capital and lowercase characters, so the text looks sort of random. There are two variants of all glyphs, so if used properly, text looks much more draw-like.

Use as you want. Public domain. Just show me what you did :)
